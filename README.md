This interactive Rock Paper Scissors game allows users to play the classic game against the computer. The game is implemented using Python and the Tkinter library, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for an engaging user experience. Users can select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and see the computer's choice along with the game result. The application features dynamic visuals to represent each choice and announce the winner of each round. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of GUI development, user input handling, and basic game logic in Python.
